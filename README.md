This repository is a collection of various coding projects that I've worked on!

# 1) BlackRock Stock Volatility Prediction

Used Machine Learning techniques and coded up a multi-layered deep neural network approach to predict volatility of BlackRock Stock price from data from previous years, with the addition of multiple hidden layers. 
Also implemented dropout for regularization, added batch normalization, incorporated validation loss tracking, early stopping, and batch processing to gain a better understanding and prediction of the data. 



# 2) Custom Poker Hand Evaluator

Developed a poker hand evaluator algorithm to compute the strength of a hand relative to all other hands using a number theoretic approach and pre-computed evaluator tables.

# 3) Customer Segmentation in Marketing

Customer segmentation for a marketing data set.

# 4) Hierarchial Clustering of Product Classification Dataset

Performed hierarchical clustering on a product classification data set.
